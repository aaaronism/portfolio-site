                <p>Outside bootcamp, I was really interested in working with an immersive interface so I started learning Three.js. A total beginner who can't get enough, I knew I had to implement this into my portfolio website. Keep up with this website to watch me incorporate new and amazing things I learn.</p>
                <h4>HTML, CSS, Javascript, Three.js</h4>

                <h3><a href="https://github.com/aaaronism/task-manager-camp-halfblood" target="_blank">Task Manager</a></h3>
                <p>given the prompt of creating a full-stack application that uses all crud operations, I decided to create a task manager in the image of my favorite book series, The Adventures of Percy Jackson. Using a MEN stack, this task manager with a fantasy twist turned into a quest manager...Time for some adventure!</p>
                <h4>HTML, CSS, Javascript, Express.js, EJS, Mongo, MongoDB</h4>

                <h3><a href="https://github.com/aaaronism/wordle-clone" target="_blank">Wordle Clone</a></h3>
                <p>my first ever project where I was given the prompt of creating a simple front-end game application, I decided to model mine after a trending favorite, Wordle! seemingly simple on the surface, only having recently learned the holy trinity of html, css, and javascript, I quickly realized the work I had ahead of me.</p>
